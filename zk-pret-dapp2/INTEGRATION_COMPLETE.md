### Backend Verification
- ✅ **Confirmed API endpoints** are already implemented
- ✅ **Verified service layer** is complete with 4 built-in templates
- ✅ **Checked TypeScript types** are properly defined
- ✅ **Validated server routes** for all composed proofs operations

### Testing & Documentation
- ✅ **Created integration test page** for API verification
- ✅ **Written comprehensive documentation** with examples
- ✅ **Added verification scripts** for both Windows and Linux
- ✅ **Provided troubleshooting guide** for common issues

## 🚀 Ready to Test

### Step 1: Start Your Server
