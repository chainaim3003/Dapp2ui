# SCF Navigation Fix - Issue Resolved! âœ…

## Problem Identified
You were not seeing the enhanced SCF functionality because there was **no SCF tab button** in the navigation bar. The enhanced SCF content was properly implemented in the code, but users had no way to access it through the user interface.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added SCF Tab Button to Navigation
Added a dedicated SCF tab button in the main navigation bar:
```html
<button class="tab-btn flex-1 px-6 py-3 text-sm font-medium rounded-md" data-tab="scf">
    <i class="fas fa-link mr-2"></i>SCF Verification
</button>
```

### 2. Added SCF Card to Compliance Overview
Added an SCF verification card in the main compliance overview section:
- **Teal gradient design** to distinguish it from other services
- **"Enhanced SCF" badge** to highlight the new functionality
- **Clickable card** that navigates directly to the SCF tab

âœ… **New SCF Verification Tab** - Click this to access the enhanced SCF functionality
