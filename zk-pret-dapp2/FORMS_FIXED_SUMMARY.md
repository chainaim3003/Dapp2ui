# ZK-PRET Forms Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The GLEIF and other tabs had empty forms because:
1. Component JavaScript files were trying to render into containers that didn't exist
2. Main HTML forms were too basic and missing required fields
3. Components weren't being properly initialized when switching tabs

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Main HTML Forms
- **GLEIF Tab**: Added LEI field, jurisdiction dropdown, and better field descriptions
- **Corporate Tab**: Added company name, registration number, jurisdiction dropdown
- **EXIM Tab**: Added license number, trade type, country selection
- All forms now have comprehensive field sets with proper validation

### 2. Fixed Component System
- Added proper component initialization in `switchTab()` method
- Added component properties to main app constructor
- Updated component files to work with main HTML forms instead of creating duplicate forms
- Added component script loading to HTML

### 3. Updated Execution Methods
- Enhanced `executeGLEIF()` to collect all form fields including optional LEI and jurisdiction
- Enhanced `executeCorporateRegistration()` to collect company name, CIN, registration number, and jurisdiction
- Enhanced `executeEXIM()` to collect all EXIM-related fields
- All methods now properly validate required fields and handle optional parameters

### 4. Component File Updates
- **gleif.js**: Renders into `gleif-content` for enhanced mode with blockchain state tracking
- **corporate.js**: Simplified to work with main form, added validation methods
- **exim.js**: Simplified to work with main form, added validation methods  
- **scf.js**: Updated to work with main form, maintains financing validation
- **risk.js**: Placeholder component for future development
- **compliance.js**: Placeholder component for future development

## Current Status
✅ **GLEIF Verification**: Full form with LEI, company name, jurisdiction
✅ **Corporate Registration**: Full form with company name, CIN, registration number, jurisdiction
✅ **EXIM Verification**: Full form with company name, license, trade type, country
✅ **SCF Verification**: Already had comprehensive form - no changes needed
✅ **Data Integrity**: Already had comprehensive form - no changes needed
✅ **Process Integrity**: Already had comprehensive form - no changes needed
✅ **Risk & Liquidity**: Already had comprehensive form - no changes needed
✅ **Deep Composition**: Already had comprehensive form - no changes needed
✅ **Registry**: Already had comprehensive form - no changes needed
✅ **Composed Proofs**: Already had comprehensive form - no changes needed

## Test Results Expected
- All tabs should now display comprehensive forms with proper fields
- Enhanced mode for GLEIF should work with blockchain state tracking
- Form validation should work properly
- All execution methods should collect form data correctly
- Component initialization should work when switching tabs

## Next Steps
1. Test the application by visiting each tab
2. Verify all forms display proper fields
3. Test form submissions with both valid and invalid data
4. Verify enhanced mode works for GLEIF
5. Test component initialization by switching between tabs
