# Composed Proofs Integration Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Compliance Page Enhancement** (`public/compliance.html`)
- ✅ **Added 4th Card**: Added "Composed Proofs" card alongside existing GLEIF, Corporate Registration, and EXIM cards
- ✅ **Updated Layout**: Changed grid from 3 columns to 4 columns (`lg:grid-cols-4`)
- ✅ **Enhanced Description**: Updated page description to mention multi-component workflows
- ✅ **Visual Design**: Purple-themed card matching the existing design aesthetic

### 2. **JavaScript Functionality** (`public/js/app.js`)
- ✅ **Template Selection**: Added `selectComposedProofTemplate()` function with visual feedback
- ✅ **Template Loading**: Enhanced `loadAvailableTemplates()` to fetch from API
- ✅ **File Management**: Added clear functions for all file upload components
- ✅ **Template Details**: Dynamic template information display with components and execution strategies

### 3. **API Integration** (`public/js/utils/api.js`)
- ✅ **API Methods**: Added complete composed proofs API client methods:
  - `getComposedProofTemplates()`
  - `getComposedProofTemplate(templateId)`
  - `executeComposedProof(request)`
  - `getComposedProofStatus(executionId)`
  - `getComposedProofCacheStats()`
  - `clearComposedProofCache()`
  - `addComposedProofTemplate(template)`

### 4. **Backend Integration** (Already Existing)
- ✅ **Server Routes**: All necessary API endpoints already implemented in `src/server.ts`
- ✅ **Service Layer**: `ComposedProofService` with full functionality
- ✅ **Built-in Templates**: 4 pre-configured templates available:
  - Full KYC Compliance
  - Financial Risk Assessment  
  - Business Integrity Check
  - Comprehensive Compliance

## How It Works

### 1. **User Flow**
1. User visits `compliance.html` and sees 4 cards including "Composed Proofs"
2. Clicking "Composed Proofs" navigates to the app with the composed-proofs tab active
3. User can select from built-in templates or create custom compositions
4. User configures global parameters and execution options
5. User executes the composed proof workflow

### 2. **Template System**
- **Built-in Templates**: Pre-configured multi-step verification workflows
- **Template Selection**: Visual selection with detailed information display
- **Dynamic Parameters**: Global parameters that apply to all components
- **Execution Options**: Parallelism, caching, retry policies

### 3. **Execution Features**
- **Multi-Component**: Combines multiple individual ZK proofs into orchestrated workflows
- **Dependency Management**: Handles component dependencies and execution order
- **Parallel Processing**: Runs independent components simultaneously
- **Intelligent Caching**: Stores successful results to avoid re-computation
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with configurable backoff strategies
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates and progress monitoring

### 4. **Templates Available**

#### **Full KYC Compliance** (`full-kyc-compliance`)
- **Components**: GLEIF + Corporate Registration + EXIM
- **Dependencies**: Corporate Registration depends on GLEIF
- **Aggregation**: All Required (minimum 2 of 3)
- **Use Case**: Complete customer onboarding verification

#### **Financial Risk Assessment** (`financial-risk-assessment`)
- **Components**: Basel3 Risk + Advanced ACTUS Risk
- **Dependencies**: None (parallel execution)
- **Aggregation**: Weighted (Basel3: 60%, ACTUS: 40%)
- **Use Case**: Credit risk evaluation and regulatory compliance

#### **Business Integrity Check** (`business-integrity-check`)
- **Components**: Business Data Integrity + Business Process Integrity
- **Dependencies**: None (parallel execution)
- **Aggregation**: All Required
- **Use Case**: Internal audit and process verification

#### **Comprehensive Compliance** (`comprehensive-compliance`)
- **Components**: All above templates combined
- **Dependencies**: Complex nested orchestration
- **Aggregation**: Weighted (KYC: 40%, Risk: 35%, Integrity: 25%)
- **Use Case**: Complete enterprise compliance assessment

## Navigation Integration

### 1. **Compliance Page to App**
- Clicking "Composed Proofs" card calls `openApp('composed-proofs')`
- This sets sessionStorage and navigates to `app.html`
- App automatically opens the composed-proofs tab

### 2. **App Tab Navigation**
- Composed Proofs tab is now available in the main app navigation
- Full functionality integrated with existing async/sync execution modes
- Consistent UI/UX with other verification tools

## Testing

### 1. **Frontend Integration Test**
- Created `test-composed-proofs-frontend.html` for testing
- Tests API connectivity, template loading, and function availability
- Can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000/test-composed-proofs-frontend.html`

### 2. **Manual Testing Steps**
1. **Start the server**: `npm start` or run your startup script
2. **Visit compliance page**: `http://localhost:3000/compliance.html`
3. **Verify 4 cards**: Should see GLEIF, Corporate, EXIM, and Composed Proofs
4. **Click Composed Proofs**: Should navigate to app with composed-proofs tab active
5. **Select template**: Click on any built-in template
6. **Load templates**: Click "Load Available Templates" button
7. **Configure and execute**: Fill parameters and execute composed proof

## API Endpoints Available

- `GET /api/v1/composed-proofs/templates` - List all templates
- `GET /api/v1/composed-proofs/templates/:id` - Get specific template

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Card not showing**: Check that `compliance.html` has the grid layout `lg:grid-cols-4`
2. **Navigation not working**: Verify the `openApp('composed-proofs')` function in compliance.html
3. **Template selection not working**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. **API calls failing**: Test the integration test page and check server status
5. **Backend not responding**: Ensure the ZK-PRET server is running and healthy

## What's Next

The integration is complete and ready for use. You can now:

1. **Use the built-in templates** for common compliance workflows
2. **Create custom compositions** for specific business needs
3. **Monitor execution progress** with real-time status updates
4. **Scale with parallel processing** and intelligent caching
5. **Extend with new templates** as requirements evolve

The composed proofs system seamlessly integrates with your existing ZK-PRET compliance infrastructure while providing powerful orchestration capabilities for complex multi-step verification workflows.
